<h2 id="long-commute">Long Commute</h2>
<p>Percentage of auto commuters traveling 20 minutes or more to work</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Lengthy commutes come in multiple varieties, and may be due to either a farther distance traveled or the lack of a direct route, regardless of mode of travel. Long commutes for drivers impact the environment through increased pollution and roadway congestion, as well as on an individual level through the increased risk for stress and less time available for physical and leisure activities that promote health and social well-being. Living in close proximity to work is not always possible or desired. However, commute times can be shortened in a variety of ways including changing departure time to miss a rush hour, working at a different location if possible, or moving closer to a more efficient route to work.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing-">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>In 2013, 60% of auto commuters in Mecklenburg County had a long commute, down slightly from 62% in 2007. Consistent with urban areas, Mecklenburg had a higher percentage of long commutes than North Carolina (54%) or the nation (57%). According to the INRIX Traffic Scorecard, the Charlotte metro area had the lowest congestion intensity of the top 25 metro areas in 2013, with an average of 18.3 hours wasted in traffic, compared to Atlanta, GA at 24.8 hours wasted and the most congested urban area, Los Angeles, CA at 62.8 hours wasted.</p>
<p>Note: The values for Mecklenburg County used in the previous paragraph are from the American Community Survey 2013 1-Year estimates, which provide the most current and reliable estimates at the county level. These values may differ from the county value displayed on the dashboard, which is calculated from the NPA values using the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/guidance_for_data_users/estimates/">Click here</a> to learn more on the difference between 1-and 5-year estimates.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know-">Did you know?</h4>
<p>Long commute times in metropolitan areas, as a measure of sprawl and residential segregation, may be associated with decreased economic opportunity, particularly for low-wage workers or workers who do not own vehicles. An analysis of metropolitan areas from the Brookings Institute found that nearly all zero-vehicle households live in neighborhoods with transit service, but those routes only connect them with 40% of jobs within 90 minutes. </p>

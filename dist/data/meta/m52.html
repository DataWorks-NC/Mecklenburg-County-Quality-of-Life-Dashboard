<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>311 is Charlotte-Mecklenburg&#39;s phone and web resource for service requests, bill payments, questions, comments and concerns. The 311 service makes government services more accessible and transparent, and is a key component of the city and county&#39;s culture of community engagement. 311 makes it easy for people to get involved in the community by picking up a phone or going online to report a problem or concern. That engagement makes a visible difference in the community, for example, when graffiti is removed from a park or a vacant property is cleaned up. Tracking 311 calls can assist neighborhoods and residents in identifying repeated problems and developing strategies to address them.</p>

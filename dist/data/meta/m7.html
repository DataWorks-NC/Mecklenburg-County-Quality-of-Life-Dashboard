<h2 id="housing-age">Housing Age</h2>
<p>Average age of single-family housing units </p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The age of housing generally reflects the development history of the county - Charlotte&#39;s oldest neighborhoods are closer to the center city and may be nearly 100 years old, while new neighborhoods continue to be built across the county. A decrease in average age in an area may indicate in-fill or redevelopment in an older neighborhood, or large numbers of new houses constructed on previously undeveloped land. </p>
<p>The average housing age may also provide an indication of the condition or character of a neighborhood&#39;s housing stock. Typically, older houses need higher levels of repair and maintenance, but offer opportunities for affordable rehabilitation or renovation and investment. A group of older homes may have historic significance or be classified as a local or national historic district. A group of newer homes is more likely to be organized around private amenities such as common areas, playgrounds, or pools. Offering a diverse mix of housing in cost, age, size, style, amenities and neighborhood settings is important to meet the needs and preferences of all residents. </p>

<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The age of each single-family housing structure (year of data collection minus year structure built) is summed and divided by the total number of single-family housing structures. Single-family includes single-family detached units, duplexes, triplexes, and mobile homes, though each structure is counted only once regardless of the number of units within it.</p>

<p>Median gross rent of renter-occupied housing units</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Gross rent is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of all utilities. Many factors determine the rental costs in neighborhoods, including age and size of housing units, home design and condition, proximity to amenities, assigned school zones, and the availability of rental units in each area. Renting provides a flexible and more financially suitable housing option for many households, but the number of renters paying more than 30% of income for housing (the traditional measure of affordability used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development) is at a historic high. A lack of geographically diverse, affordable housing options can force trade-offs in both housing quality and spending on other critical needs such as food, health care and transportation.</p>
<p>####How are we doing?
Median gross rent has climbed steadily in Mecklenburg County, from $792 in 2007 to $897 in 2013. The number of renters who are housing cost-burdened has also increased, as has the total number of renters. In 2013, 50% of renter households were cost-burdened (paying more than 30% of income on housing) and 26% of renter households were severely cost-burdened (paying more than 50% of income on housing). While some households choose to pay a higher percentage of income on housing, many low- and moderate-income households are constrained by a lack of affordable housing options.</p>
<p>Note: The values for Mecklenburg County used in the previous paragraph are from the American Community Survey 2013 1-Year estimates, which provide the most current and reliable estimates at the county level. These values may differ from the county value displayed on the dashboard, which is calculated from the NPA values using the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/guidance_for_data_users/estimates/">Click here</a> to learn more on the difference between 1-and 5-year estimates.</p>
<p>####Did you know?
The fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Mecklenburg County is $813. At minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, occupants would have to work an equivalent of 2.2 full-time jobs to afford this apartment, using HUD&#39;s affordability threshold of 30% of income.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The median gross rent of renter-occupied housing units as estimated in the American Community Survey (ACS).  </p>
<p>Median gross rent is inflation-adjusted to the most recent year of the five-year estimate. When a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) is comprised of more than one block group, the median gross rent is calculated by linear interpolation from the Gross Rent range tables published in the ACS; the margin of error is not calculated for the re-calculated median and will show as blank in the data table.  When combining NPAs into larger geographies, the median gross rent is estimated by averaging the median gross rent for each NPA weighted by the total number of renter-occupied housing units in each NPA. When combining NPAs into larger geographies, this variable should be used with caution.</p>

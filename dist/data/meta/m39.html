<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Adult education levels are closely related to individual economic opportunity, financial stability, and even health. Education levels are also a factor in business location and expansion decisions, as they indicate both the qualifications of the workforce and the potential market for certain goods and services. Educational attainment varies widely by age, family income, and race and ethnicity. At the neighborhood level, differences in educational attainment can persist across generations, as children living in neighborhoods with high adult educational attainment tend to have greater exposure to the world of work and higher expectations for their own education and employment prospects.</p>

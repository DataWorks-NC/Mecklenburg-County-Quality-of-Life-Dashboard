<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Homeownership can provide multiple benefits to owners and communities. Although a mortgage and home maintenance can be a financial burden, homeownership may also provide households with tax benefits, collateral for financial emergencies, and opportunities for wealth creation. Homeownership is also associated with residential stability, and may catalyze a personal investment in home maintenance, neighborhood improvement and community cohesion. However, renting often provides a more flexible and financially suitable housing option for households, particularly in times of economic recession or housing market decline. The rate of homeownership is closely tied to the share of the housing stock available to own rather than rent, household size and composition, and demographic characteristics such as age, income, race/ethnicity and education. </p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing-">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>In 2013, the homeownership rate in Mecklenburg County was 60%, compared to 66% in North Carolina and 65% in the United States. Mirroring national trends, homeownership in Mecklenburg County has fallen steadily since a pre-recession high of 67.2% in 2008. The U.S. homeownership rate declined for the ninth consecutive year in 2013, falling to 65.1%, the lowest rate since 1995.</p>
<p>Note: The values for Mecklenburg County used in the previous paragraph are from the American Community Survey 2013 1-Year estimates, which provide the most current and reliable estimates at the county level. These values may differ from the county value displayed on the dashboard, which is calculated from the NPA values using the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/guidance_for_data_users/estimates/">Click here</a> to learn more on the difference between 1-and 5-year estimates.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know-">Did you know?</h4>
<p>According to research from the Federal Reserve Bank, the homeownership rate is likely to increase over the long-term as the U.S. population ages. However, with population growth expected to be driven by non-White households, Hispanic and African-American homeownership rates must rise for the overall homeownership rate to rise. The homeownership gap between White and Hispanic or African-American head of households is nearly 30 percentage points.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Renovation permits are issued for existing residential housing units for projects such as remodeling, adding space, building garages, or retrofitting to improve energy efficiency or allow aging in place. Residential renovation activity provides an indication of how and where people choose to invest in housing, and may be impacted by a broad variety of factors including housing market trends, household size and income, construction lending standards, age and condition of available housing stock, and neighborhood amenities. A large increase in renovation activity, especially in established neighborhoods, could signal broad-based neighborhood change that may impact housing affordability, particularly for renters or households with fixed incomes. </p>
<p>####How are we doing?
In fiscal year 2013, 5,714 residential units were permitted for renovation, 17% more than in fiscal year 2011.</p>

<p>Percentage of residential solid waste diverted from landfills through recycling and yard waste processing</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Residential solid waste includes garbage, recycled items, yard waste and non-recyclable bulky items. All waste that is not recycled or composted is buried in a landfill, requiring large amounts of land and producing greenhouse gases as garbage decomposes. Diverting solid waste from landfills saves money for families and communities, saves energy and water, reduces air and water pollution, and conserves natural resources. Solid waste diversion can be increased by increasing recycling participation and separating yard waste from garbage.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing-">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 75% of solid waste is recyclable. Households in the City of Charlotte diverted just under 36% of solid waste from the landfill in 2013, virtually unchanged since 2011. </p>
<h4 id="did-you-know-">Did you know?</h4>
<p>More than 100,000 tons of yard trimmings were received at Mecklenburg County composting facilities in 2013. While compost is available for purchase in bulk by the public, Mecklenburg County sells most of its compost to a private vendor, which in turn bags and sells the compost in stores. </p>

<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Tonnage of residential recycled waste and yard waste collected from the City of Charlotte for the fiscal year from eligible households, divided by the total tonnage of residential solid waste collected from eligible households. Residential solid waste includes garbage, recycling, yard waste and non-recyclable bulky items. The data include single family residential units (attached and detached), multi-family buildings with fewer than 30 units, and any additional legacy multi-family buildings serviced by the City of Charlotte. Towns in Mecklenburg County are not included because solid waste data are not collected at the neighborhood level.</p>

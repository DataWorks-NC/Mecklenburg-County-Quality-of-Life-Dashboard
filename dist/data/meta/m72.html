<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>There are a variety of opportunities to be engaged with local government on the city, town and county level. Board and committee appointees have the opportunity to make important policy recommendations and administrative decisions that impact neighborhoods and the broader community. The use of boards and committees provides many benefits to both government and community - they provide opportunity for in-depth examination of issues, create a communication channel between elected officials and the community, bring a broad range of ideas and expertise to public decision-making, serve as a way to build consensus and assist in the resolution of conflicts, and provide training for new community leaders. To best serve local leaders and the community, boards and commissions should reflect the diversity of the local community in terms of population, geography, and viewpoint.</p>

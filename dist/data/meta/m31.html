<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Vacant units are an occurrence in all areas and may be caused by a variety of factors, such as periods of for rent or sale, an over-supply of housing at specific price points, economic forces in the housing market, property foreclosure or abandonment, or housing design or quality that impacts desirability. When vacant properties are not maintained, they can increase risk for vandalism, arson, and other types of crime, and may lead to further disinvestment. The vacancy rate may reflect different types of potential in a housing market. A combination of low vacancy rate and some amount of undeveloped land may indicate opportunities for development or redevelopment. Alternatively, a high vacancy rate may signal opportunities for creative and productive reuse of properties for such purposes as urban farms, community gardens, neighborhood centers, and health facilities. As vacancy rates decline, areas may experience increases in rental costs and home prices, and a decrease in affordable housing units.</p>

<p>In 2013, the percentage of housing units that were vacant in Mecklenburg County was 9%, down from a recent high of 10.7% in 2010. The homeowner vacancy rate was 1.9 while the renter vacancy rate was 4.6. Mecklenburg County had lower vacancy rates than both North Carolina (14.5%) and the U.S. (12.4%). </p>

<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Number of occupied housing units divided by the total number of housing units. </p>
<p>The occupancy rate, rather than the vacancy rate, is calculated because figures for vacancy at the neighborhood scale are statistically unreliable. This is because relatively small numbers of housing units are vacant versus occupied, and it is generally difficult to generate reliable estimates for small populations from sample surveys like the American Community Survey.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Financial services, such as basic checking and savings accounts, are foundations for financial security. In addition, access to affordable, healthy credit and freedom from high-interest loans are essential for community health. Banks and credit unions provide financial services to businesses and individuals, and, while there are fees and other costs associated with these services, they are regulated and insured by government agencies. When physical, financial or other barriers exist to accessing services through banks and credit unions, people often rely on alternative financial services such as check cashing outlets, payday lenders, and pawn shops. While these providers offer convenient services and easy access to cash, their services often carry high costs, limiting families&#39; abilities to accumulate assets and establish a credit history. </p>

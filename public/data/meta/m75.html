<p>Where people work has implications for housing markets, the retail industry, transportation and other infrastructure needs, and may also impact environmental and physical health. Daytime population, or the population of a place in the middle of the day, often looks very different than the standard definition of population ï¿½ where people sleep. Businesses that serve employment centers, such as restaurant and bars, can see where to locate that may not be apparent while looking at traditional population data. This information may also help plan for housing that more efficiently serves job centers, reduces commute times, and promotes the use of public transit and active commuting modes. </p>

<p>Number of all jobs divided by total land area. Numbers of jobs were obtained at the block group level and aggregated to Neighborhood Profile Areas. For the source dataset, a job is defined as a link between a worker and a firm at which the work has been employed for two consecutive quarters. The data exclude federal civilian employees, uniformed military, self-employed workers and informally employed workers. If a worker was employed at more than one job and those jobs are covered by the core datasets, then all of those jobs will be included.  </p>

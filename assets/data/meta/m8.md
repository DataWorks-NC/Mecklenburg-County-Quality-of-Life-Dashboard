## Residential New Construction
Concentration of housing units permitted for new construction 

### Why is this important?
Residential new construction may be single- or multi-family, and can be built on previously undeveloped land, as infill on vacant urban lots, or as replacement housing where other structures have been demolished. New construction activity provides an indication of how and where people choose to live, and may be impacted by a broad variety of factors including housing market trends, household size and income, construction lending standards, the availability of developable land, age and condition of available housing stock, and neighborhood amenities. New residential construction generally increases population and housing density, and in established neighborhoods, an increase in new construction may also impact housing affordability, particularly for renters or households with fixed incomes. 

####How are we doing?
There were 4,102 housing units permitted for new construction in fiscal year 2013, down marginally from fiscal year 2011, continuing the slowdown in residential construction activity precipitated by the recession. As the population and number of households in Mecklenburg County continues to grow, so too will the need for new housing units. From 2000 to 2012, there were 93,000 housing units constructed in Charlotte. The proportion of new housing that is single-family has declined significantly since the housing crisis, from 56% single-family prior to 2007 to 37% single-family after 2007.
